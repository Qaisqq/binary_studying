-- Overview of different number systems (Decimal, Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal):
    A number system is a method of representing values on a numberline by using symbols, and rules.
    These symbols are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and are called digits
    The four common number types are:
        Binary :        Base 2      -> 0, 1
        Octal :         Base 8      -> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
        Decimal:        Base 10     -> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
        Hexadecimal :   Base 16     -> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F

-- Importance of number systems in computing:
    -Representing data: binary is used to represent transistor states
                        where as hexadecimal is used to represent those same binary numbers, but on a bigger scale
                        decimal is used for when we need to discern numbers visually and work with them
    -memory optimziation:   
                some number systems simply require less data to representsome values as compared to other number systems
                so theres an aspect of optmizaing your memory allocation if you used different number systems for different data


2. Binary:         <Bi for two>
    Used to explain tasks to a computer, since theres only two states 0 and 1
    These two states represente the two states of a transistor, 0 = no current // 1 = current passsed through
    Each digit in a binary number is called a single Bit
    -A representation of decimal to binary:
        Decimal -> Binary
        0 -> 0, 1 -> 1
        2 -> 10, 3 -> 11
        4 -> 100, 5 -> 101, 6 -> 110, 7 -> 111
        8 -> 1000, 9 -> 1001, 10 -> 1010, 11 - > 1010, 12 -> 1100, 13 -> 1101, 14 -> 1110, 15 -> 1111
        16 -> 10000 etc

    -Binary vs Decimal:
        Base:
            B: base-2
            D: base-10
        representation:
            B: 2^0 2^1 2^2 2^3
            D: 10^0 10^1 10^2 10^3
        usage:
            B: digital and electronic devices use it as a fundemental number system, because of digital logic circuits
            D: best used for human familiarity, used for human calcuations, and data representation, when humans need readibility and precision
        size:
            B: less space efficient, needs more digits to represent same data as decimal
            D: more space-efficient, needs less digits to represent same data as binary

3. Bit?:
    -A bit is: 
            a single binary digit, which is either a 0 or 1
            0 is a bit// 01 is two bits
            bits is the fundemental building block of ALL digital information

    -A byte is:
            00000000 is 8 bits, which is called a byte, if theyre all full
            11111111 its the max value of a byte which is 255 in decimal

    -Binary place values:
            In the binary number system, each digit's place value corresponds to a power of 2. The rightmost digit represents the least significant bit (LSB)
            while the leftmost digit represents the most significant bit (MSB). Here's how binary place values work:

            MSB (Most Significant Bit):
                                    This is the leftmost digit in a binary number and holds the highest place value.

            LSB (Least Significant Bit):
                                    This is the rightmost digin in a binary number and holds the smallests place value.
            Place Values:
                        Moving from right to left, each successive digit's place value doubles.
                        It starts with 1 for the rightmost bit (also called the 1's place), then 2 for the next bit (2's place), 4 for the next (4's place), and so on.

                ... 128  64  32  16   8   4   2   1   (Place values)
                ...   0   0   0   0   1   1   0   1   (Example binary number)
                ______________________________________
                                      8 + 4     + 1
                     15 Decimal == 1101 Binary
